# Cheatsheet generator

[Working live site](https://gimme-cheats.netlify.app/)

This is an app that is used to generate a docx of cheatsheets - a word -> word translation in a small format to fit in the hand.

Since the process is tedious to generate these, even if one has a list of words, I'm creating this tool that should make it less boring.

In the future it will hold previously generated cheatsheets for others to used and search for.

## Structure

Project is built as a monorepo for flexibility and ease of swapping and changing ideas. Currently there are 3 packages in this repo, but i presume it will grow a bit:

- `client` - CRA with all the frontend functionality
- `server` - GraphQL server
- `utils` - currently not so big repo of useful things throughout the project (think a wonky lodash)

It's been ocasionally a pain to set up (CRA didn't play nicely with using code outside of `src` folder, or configuring typescript not to whine constantly with many too many tsconfigs), but once I got through those hurdles it's such an enjoyable set up (+ my disk space doesn't disappear from all node modules..).

## Tech used

- Create React App with Concurrent mode enabled
- MobX and mobx-state-tree
- Chakra-UI
- Type-GraphQL
- Type-ORM
- Apollo Server
- PostgreSQL
- Redis (managing sessions) (will be added)

## Plans

My main goal was to create a tool to input lists of words and get a generated document back. But I've already acieved that so I moved on to bigger plans - to add the backend for storing lists generated by users, suggesting translations when user types in a word, voting on good lists, having verified lists from English school-books and many more.
